Practice/Study Timer
=============

Simple practice/study timer, initially written as a way to learn Swift and CoreData.

Item titles in the list are color coded based on the last time they were engaged (green, yellow, red).

Item detail view provides timer functions, and data presentation. A line graph details time spent over
the past week; a circle graph details percent of time goal completed.

Graphs are part of kevinzhow's Objective-C graph library.
